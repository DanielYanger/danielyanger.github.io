<p>Iâ€™ve decided to create a website/blog to host all of the programming related things that Iâ€™ve done and will be doing through high school.</p>

<p>For now Iâ€™ll keep the blog on this Weebly site but I may look to transition over to another platform in the future as an exercise in programming.</p>
